# React Native Prerequisites (5-Day Crash Plan)

## 1. Core Programming Basics
- JavaScript fundamentals: variables, functions, arrays, objects
- ES6+ features: `let/const`, arrow functions, destructuring, modules
- Async concepts: `Promise`, `async/await`, basic error handling with `try/catch`

## 2. React Fundamentals (Required Before React Native)
- Components, props, state
- Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`
- Rendering lists and conditional UI
- Handling form input and button events

## 3. TypeScript Basics (Strongly Recommended)
- Primitive types and object types
- Interfaces for props and data models
- Typing function params and return values
- Optional fields and union types

## 4. Mobile App Concepts
- Difference between Android and iOS behavior
- Screen layouts for different device sizes
- Basic app flow: list screen, details/form screen, navigation between screens
- Network and offline mindset (loading, error, empty states)

## 5. Tooling You Must Be Comfortable With
- Node.js and npm
- Expo CLI / React Native CLI (Expo is faster for a 5-day timeline)
- Git basics: `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`
- VS Code usage and debugging logs

## 6. React Native-Specific Essentials
- Core components: `View`, `Text`, `TextInput`, `Pressable`, `FlatList`
- Styling with `StyleSheet` and Flexbox
- Navigation (stack navigation basics)
- Local persistence (`AsyncStorage`)

## 7. Recommended Setup Checklist
- Install Node.js LTS
- Install Expo Go on your phone (or Android Emulator / iOS Simulator)
- Run the app locally once (`npm start`) before coding features
- Verify TypeScript and linting are working

## 8. Minimum “Ready to Build” Criteria
You are ready to implement your 5-day project if you can:
- Build a small form with React state
- Render and update a list
- Navigate between two screens
- Save and read simple data locally
